        Polus.GG was a very large mod and custom private server for Among Us, and was one of my first work experiences,
        especially with a decent sized team.
        <br><br>
        One of my best examples of working into an existing codebase, I was tasked with maintaining the biggest game mode
        on the platform, implementing user requests and working with artist.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately the project was cut short due to multiple inevitable failures, as if it collapsed under its own weight.
        Mouthwash.GG was my successor project, written below.
