    <p>
        Polus.GG was a very large mod and custom private server for Among Us, and was one of my first work experiences,
        especially with a decent sized team.
        <br><br>
        One of my best examples of working into an existing codebase, I was tasked with maintaining the biggest game mode
        on the platform

        Talking about Edith wouldn't be complete without talking about Chronicle, an app I am making along-side Edith, taking control
        of conversations between characters, interactions with objects, character portraits, timeline/screenplay and save data. It's
        entirely friendly for non-developers, making it a good tool for development on Edith; working with an artist who otherwise
        would have no other way to write dialogues and interactions directly into the game.
        <br><br>
        I developed integration with <a href="/t/unity">Unity</a> so that the Chronicle files are recognised as ScriptableObjects and assets,
        meaning they can be referenced directly and bundled into the game.
        <br><br>
        Chronicle was a great experience to learn about user interfaces, file-system handling and complex web-based controls so that it
        feels like a native app. It's written in <a href="/l/js">TypeScript</a> and <a href="/t/svelte">Svelte</a>, and built ontop of 
        <a href="https://tauri.app">Tauri</a>. I also used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">TailwindCSS</a> for the first time.
