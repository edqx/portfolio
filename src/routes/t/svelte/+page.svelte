    <p>
        My beloved <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a> is by far one of my favourite and best frameworks I've been able to work with. I use it for just about
        every website, as well as desktop apps that I've made with <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron</a> or <a href="https://tauri.app">Tauri</a>.
        <br><br>
        I've also used all three major routing frameworks for Svelte: <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a>, <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>,
        <a href="https://www.routify.dev/">Routify</a>, as well as just Svelte on its own.
        <br><br>
        I've also developed my sites to both <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, as well as hosting manually
        through cloud hosting providers or just deploying a static site onto <a href="https://github.io">GitHub pages</a>
