    <p>
        Possibly my most proficient tool, I used Node.JS for the majority of my projects up until about a year ago, and arguably my best ones too.
        <br><br>
        I've used almost all of the native Node.JS APIs, from cryptography to extensive file system use, to work with raw networking sockets.
        My work on <a href="/p/pgg#mwgg">Mouthwash</a> includes all three of these, using cryptography for authorisation, using <a href="/p/skeldjs">SkeldJS</a>
        which implemented a secure DTLS implementation, and making use of plugins for <a href="/p/skeldjs#hb">Hindenburg</a>, navigating a complex file structure.
        <br><br>
        Within the Node.JS ecosystem through NPM, I've used many popular libraries â€” for example <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.JS</a> for a HTTP Rest API for
        <a href="/p/swagclan">SwagClan</a>, and <a href="http://vorpal.js.org/">Vorpal</a> for an interactive command line with <a href="/p/skeldjs#hb">Hindenburg</a>.
        I've even created and published my own, with <a href="/p/skeldjs">SkeldJS</a> being a prime example of a fully-fledged library with several intertwined packages,
        being maintained for a few years. I've also used more heavy libraries such as <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron</a> and <a href="https://tauri.app">Tauri</a>
        to build cross-platform Desktop apps, such as my work on <a href="/p/edith#chronicle">Chronicle</a>.
        <br><br>
        I also have lots of experience with build and package tools such as <a href="https://yarnpkg.org">Yarn</a> and <a href="https://lerna.js.org">Lerna</a>.
        <br><br>
        Node.JS is important to me as a modern, safe and fast way to write scalable and reliable server-side code.
