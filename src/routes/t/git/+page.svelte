    <p>
        Basically a necessity under a developer's toolset, I've used git almost exclusively for source management ever since I started programming.
        <br><br>
        I know how to create, delete and checkout branches, stashes, resolve conflicts, use remote repositories, discard changes,
        and of course â€” to force push.
