    <p>
        Unity is a new one for me, starting to only ever use it properly in 2022. I've previously written mods for Unity, such as mods for Among Us
        and my work for <a href="/p/pgg">Polus.GG</a>, and I've implemented part of Unity's ECS (Entity Component System) and fixed update cycle for
        <a href="/p/skeldjs">SkeldJS</a>.
        <br><br>
        It has become a daily tool for work since I started using it for <a href="/p/edith">Edith</a>, and I've come to develop custom inspector UIs,
        and connect it to my <a href="/p/edith">Chronicle</a> app, allowing me to use Chronicle's files directly in Unity.
        <br><br>
        Unity has also been an experience in terms of handling assets and artwork, such as structuring and managing files in an organised way in order
        to scale to hundreds if not thousands of future sprites.
        <br><br>
        It's also given me experience, on top of <a href="/p/pgg">Polus.GG</a>, with working <em>with</em> an artist on developing for specific requirements
        and a good UI system.
