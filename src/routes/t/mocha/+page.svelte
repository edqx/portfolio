        Whenever I do unit tests for my projects — which is not as often as I should — I always use <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>.
        <br><br>
        I've used it to a decent degree, including it with TypeScript and tools such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc">NYC</a>
        and <a href="https://istanbul.js.org/">Istanbul</a> in order to produce a code coverage report, even setting up a project on
        <a href="https://app.codecov.io/gh/SkeldJS/SkeldJS">CodeCov</a> to digest and track coverage over time.
