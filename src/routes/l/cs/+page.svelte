    <p>
        As a programming language I'm reasonably familiar with, I've used C# generally for writing code in relation to games and modding. I've
        made several mods and contributed to existing mods for Among Us, such as <a href="https://github.com/edqx/Edward.SkipAuth">SkipAuth</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/edqx/Edward.ForceFreeChat">ForceFreeChat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SkeldJS/Dumpostor">Dumpostor</a>.
        <br><br>
        My main project currently, <a href="/p/edith">Edith</a>, is written in C# with <a href="/t/Unity">Unity</a> and explores in a lot more depth
        how to structure and write performant code.
        <br><br>
        I have experience using Visual Studio, and also JetBrains' Rider which I prefer, using the debuggers with both and connecting to Unity with Rider.
