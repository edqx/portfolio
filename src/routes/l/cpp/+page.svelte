        I spent over a year working on a mod for the video game CS:GO, which was written in C++. It was almost entirely from
        scratch, and gave me great insight and experience into the fundamentals of computer memory and assembly.
        <br><br>
        I've also written a DLL injector program, now long gone, which allowed me to inject a compiled DLL of
        the mod into a CS:GO running process, which would go undetected by the game's anti-cheat.
        <br><br>
        I've also used C++ for several short scripts that were required to run very efficiently, such as searching through masses
        amount of data on the file system to search for data, which I used for my <a href="https://github.com/edqx/diabotical-crawler">Diabotical account crawler</a>.
